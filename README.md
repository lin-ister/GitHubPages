###### My Background

Hi everyone!
My name is Brian. I am a 4th year Computer Science undergraduate who transferred from the Los Angeles area.

I originally did not transfer in as a Computer Sciencemajor, rather I transferred with intentions of graduating as an Electrical Engineering major and I had little to no experience with programming and coding. Not getting into the EE, I decided to explore my other options in the engineering field and ultimately chose the Computer Science department. It has been very interesting so far learning about C++, Java, and many different programming languages. I have yet to find a programming language to stick with and I am excited for the opportunities that programming will bring to the table for my career path.

I am into collecting shoes and Nintendo. My hobbies are researching popular brands for clothing and listening to new music everyday. 

***This is my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lin_ister/) where I post my clothing style :D***
